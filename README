This is my root workspace that I use to build all the software I've
written, patched, or simply want to build myself. All of my builds
use [bazel][0]. My own projects are bazel-enabled, and have
their own WORKSPACE files; you can build them without this
repo. However, for binaries that have cross-project or external
dependencies, my published binaries are built from this workspace.
